					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> YouTube Wireframe </p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/wireframe.png" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p>YouTube Redesigned Wireframe </p>
							<img src = "assets/imgs/redesigned.png" />
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to deliver the needs of the user in a efficient and impactful way. For my design, I prioritized user attention and shifted it to the main popular videos when the screen first pops open. I thought the original was too cluttered so I tried to space my elements. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> I made my website redesign less cluttered by removing the side buttons and enlarging some of the videos. I also removed the user profile below every video in the original wireframe.  </p>
