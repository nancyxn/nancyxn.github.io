					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> That whitespace is actually more beneficial than harmful as it focuses the user attention. While some may say that it's wasted space, it actually balances the content and supports the page's elements. Others also claim that users may miss the content but I learned that users will scroll for sure so nothing will be unseen, for the most part. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the articles were definitely the images the author attached to the article. It shows what they are saying and allows the readers to visual learn more about the contents of the website. I like how the author featured more than one element of the same website which allows us to follow through with the critique of Wayfair's site.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
