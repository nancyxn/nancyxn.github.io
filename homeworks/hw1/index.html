    <!-- Paragraph about myself-->
    <p> Hello, my name is Nancy Nguyen. I am a current transfer student on my last year at UC Berkeley! Some things about me is that I love seafood boil and playing my cello. I used to be in orchestra for 4 years and a jazz band for 3 years. Professionally, I hope to become a UX/UI designer so I hope to take this web design class to break into design.  </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1) Something I learned is to always study/focus on other apps to see the design details such as placeholder text and timestamps. Another thing I learned is you need to learn the design rules in order to break them and create something user friendly and unique.</li>
            <li>2) My favorite part of this article are the images the author attached to the site that makes it more comprehensive and easily understood. I liked how the images also move as well which catches my eye and makes me want to look at it longer. </li>
            <li>3) "You develop your design eye by thinking as if you were the designer of a product." </li>
            <li>4) From a scale of 1-10, I give this article a 7. It could've been longer. </li>
