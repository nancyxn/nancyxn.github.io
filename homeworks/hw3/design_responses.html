						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that, with typography, it's important to have a purpose and inspiration. Good typography caters to the intended audience so designers need to know what each audience prefers whether it be children or senior citizens. Additionally, finding inspiration online to see which fonts pair well together is an important process for all designers in order to establish visual hierarchy and improve readibility. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article are the resources given. Sites and articles that help designers with font, font pairs, sizes and guidelines are extremely useful for new designers. I intend to use Modular Scale for font size help, CreativeBloq for inspiration and Sketch to use as style guide. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
